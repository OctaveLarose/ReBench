## [1.1.0] Denoise - 2020-09-17

This release focuses on reducing the noise from the system.
For this purpse, it introduces the `rebench-denoise` tool, which will adapt
system parameters to:

- change CPU governor to the performance setting
- disables turbo boost
- reduces the sampling frequency allowed byte the kernel
- execute benchmarks with CPU shielding and `nice -n-20`

Note that the use of `rebench-denoise` will require root rights.
It can also be used as stand-alone tool, for which documentation is here:
https://rebench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/denoise/

Thanks to @tobega and @qinsoon for contributing bug fixes.

 - added denoise, the noise reduction tool (#143, #144)
 - `-R` now disables data reporting, replacing the previous `-S` (#145)
 - added support to report experiment completion to ReBenchDB (#149)
 - fixed JMH support (#147)
 - fixed string/byte encoding issues between Python 2 and 3 (#142)
 - updated py-cpuinfo (#137, #138, #141)

## [1.0.1] - 2020-06-23

This is a bug fix release.

 - adopt py-cpuinfo 6.0.0 and pin version to avoid issues with changing APIs (#138)
   Thanks to @tobega for the fix!

## [1.0.0] Foundations - 2020-05-02

This is the first official release of ReBench as a "feature-complete" product.
Feature-complete here means, it is a tried and tested tool for benchmark
execution. It is highly 
[configurable](https://rebench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/),
[documented](https://rebench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and [successfully used](https://github.com/smarr/ReBench#use-in-academia).

This 1.0 release does not signify any new major features, but instead marks a
point where ReBench has been stable and relieable for a long time.

ReBench is designed to

 - enable reproduction of experiments;
 - document all benchmark parameters;
 - provide a flexible execution model,
   with support for interrupting and continuing benchmarking;
 - enable the definition of complex sets of comparisons
   and their flexible execution;
 - report results to continuous performance monitoring systems,
   e.g., Codespeed or ReBenchDB;
 - provide basic support for building/compiling benchmarks/experiments
   on demand;
 - be extensible to parse output of custom benchmark harnesses.

ReBench isn't

 - a framework for microbenchmarks.
   Instead, it relies on existing harnesses and can be extended to parse their
   output.
 - a performance analysis tool. It is meant to execute experiments and
   record the corresponding measurements.
 - a data analysis tool. It provides only a bare minimum of statistics,
   but has an easily parseable data format that can be processed, e.g., with R.

To use ReBench, install it with Python's pip:

```bash
pip install rebench
```

### Acknowledgements

ReBench has been used by a number of people over the years, and their feedback
and [contributions](https://github.com/smarr/ReBench/graphs/contributors)
made it what it is today. Not all of these contributions are recorded,
but I'd still like to thank everyone, from the annoymous reviewer of artifacts,
to the students who had to wade through bugs and missing documentation.
Thank you!

## [1.0rc1] - 2018-08-02

 - made user interface more consistent and concise (#83, #85, #92, #101, #102)
 - added concept of iterations/invocations (#82, #87)
 - added executor and suite name as command variables (#95, #101)
 - added and improved support for building suites before execution (#59, #78, #84, #96)
 - revised configuration format to me more consistent and add schema (#74, #82, #66, #94, #101)

 - added support to verify parameter and config file (#104)
 - added [documentation][docs] (#66, #101)
 - use PyLint (#79)

## [0.10.1] - 2018-06-08

 - fixed experiment filters and reporting on codespeed submission errors (#77)

## [0.10.0] - 2018-06-08

 - restructured command-line options in help, and use argparse (#73)
 - added support for Python 3 and PyPy (#65)
 - added support for extra criteria (things beside run time) (#64)

## [0.9.1] - 2017-12-21

 - fixed time-left reporting of invalid times (#60)
